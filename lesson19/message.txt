Python was conceived in the late 1980s[43] by Guido van Rossum at
Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor
to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[44] capable
 of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.
 [13] Its implementation began in December 1989.[45] Van Rossum shouldered
 sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July
 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities
 as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community
 bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief
 decision-maker.[46] In January 2019, active Python core developers elected
  a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[47][48]
